# Javascript before any frameworks
Few days ago from today, I had an interview for the front-end dev position. I was quite confident/ready about answering React type of questions, but the interview was pretty simple: build an to-do app with the pure javascript without any framework. 
I learned I was so lack of javascript fundamentals. So, I just created this repo for myself to keep up with my js knowledge from the bottom.

It is nothing fancy, but just ugly(least stylied) javascript app. I'll add notes for each project about what I learned.
