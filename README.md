# Javascript before any frameworks
I still remember that I had an interview for a front-end dev position. I was quite confident/ready about answering React type of questions (and leetcode type), but the interview was all about plain javascript fundamentals as it required to build a to-do app without any framework or library. 
I realized I was so lack of javascript fundamentals. So, I just created this repo for myself to keep up with my js knowledge from the bottom.

It is nothing fancy, but just ugly(least stylied) javascript app.
